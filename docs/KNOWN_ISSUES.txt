Known issues:
  - borders/padding between items really mess things up.
  - there's still a few places where horizontal/vertical checks could
    be moved from point-of-execution into the initialization via
    various ugly tricks (binding a different mousemove function
    depending on orientation for example), if you want to get really
    picky about optimizing for speed.
  - XHTML namespace extension bits probably don't play nice in HTML4.
  - ought to wrap the prototype calls in a wrapper to make it easier
    for people to rewrite for a different toolkit, or their own code.
  - no keyboard equivilent for the mouseover fun.
